# 📊 Instagram Reach Analysis & Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
A machine learning-based Instagram reach analysis and prediction project using Python. This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to optimize engagement strategies. Ideal for influencers, businesses, and marketers looking to refine their content approach using data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values and outliers.
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizes engagement trends with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
✅ **Word Cloud Generation** – Extracts key themes from hashtags and captions.
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Implements PassiveAggressiveRegressor for prediction.
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Uses Instagram metrics like impressions, likes, comments, shares, and profile visits.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
